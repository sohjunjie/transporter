# CZ2006 Project Files

#### This repository will contain all project files we will be working on for CZ2006 Software Engineering



## Checking out project into Eclipse IDE
Follow the following instructions to clone the project files into your Eclipse IDE

1. Open the welcome screen (help > welcome)

## Pulling changes to the project

####**Switch to master branch**

   The master branch is the most definitive branch containing the latest working 
   copy of the project in github. Pull the latest changes by right clicking the project
   folder then

  `Team > Switch To... > Master  # if not in master branch`  
  `Team > Pull                   # get latest changes`  



## Pull Request, additions, changes to code, etc

**Notice to collaborators performing edits on the project.**

All local development and changes to the master copy should be done in
appropriately named branches

**Do not** merge your changes directly into your local master branch and push to Git
**unless** you know what you are doing!!!

If you are done developing the component you are working on, push your
branch to GitHub by doing:

`git push -u origin <branch_name>`

After that, visit the

[Git repository page](//github.com/sohjunjie/transporter/) and open a

pull request to the `master` branch.

Give your pull request a title and describe what you are trying to do
and self-review your code. Merge to master only if you are sure of 
your changes. If not, get someone to review your code.
